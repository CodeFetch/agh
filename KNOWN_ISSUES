Here we report known issues regarding AGH and related tools. An issue may be added here when there is no obvious way to solve
it (e.g.: we do not know how to fix it, or we think it depends on code outside of this repository).

Some memory allocations are not allowed to fail
====================
In some cases, when calling GLib functions like g_strdup, a memory allocation failure will cause the program to terminate,
with no chance for us to try to handle the failure.

MMBearer GObjects may leak
====================
When no disconnection events are emitted for a bearer object, but the object becomes "stale?" (e.g.: because the modem to
which the bearer was related gets unplugged), then AGH will leak the object.

Is something wrong happening with data representation?
====================
In the agh_mm_start_bearer_checker function, found in agh_modem.c: why should I use the G_GINT32_FORMAT specified to display the value?
Is something wrong going on?

Memory leak in libconfig
====================
It seems a memory leak happens in libconfig every time it is presented with some invalid config strings. We need to look at this. I submitted a GitHub issue at:
https://github.com/hyperrealm/libconfig/issues/142
